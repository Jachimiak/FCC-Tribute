        <h2> Time Before the Orcs Arrival</h2>

        <p>Cairne Bloodhoof was a nomad, along with his tribe, in the Barrens of Kalimdor. This time was before the invasion of the orcs and humans. Along with his lifemate, Tamaala, and their son Baine, they traveled the land, always seeking refuge from
          the centaurs, the one constant threat. Cairne was known as a wise leader and an exceptional warrior. His everlasting hope was to locate a new land where his people could live peacefully. Without the fear of the marauding centaurs. </p>

        <h2> The Third War</h2>

        <p>Everything changed when Cairne came in contact with Thrall. Thrall had recently traveled from the Eastern Kingdoms, looking for an escape from the human aggressors that had devastated his race. Cairne saw the orc leader destroy a group of centaurs
          who had been attacking the Tauren. Cairne was impressed. Thrall was searching for his destiny. Cairne knew that the young shaman would need to travel north, to the Oracle, and directed Thrall there.</p>

        <p>Thrall reported seeing an army of centaur going north, in the direction of Cairne's village. Cairne quickly headed in the direction of the centaur army, knowing the destruction they would leave behind them. Thrall, seeing the compassion and strength
          in the Tauren brought his followers with him and assisted Cairne in defending his village. After the defensive stand, Cairne told Thrall of his hopes. Thrall vowed to protect the caravan of Tauren as the traveled to Mulgore as the Tauren assisted
          him with the location of the Oracle.</p>

        <p>As the arrived in Mulgore, Cairne kept his word and explained to Thrall that the Oracle could be found within Stonetalon Peak. Cairne, knowing there might be trouble at the site of the Oracle, met up with Thrall, and helped free the orcs from
          the harpies. Finally, at the peak, the Tauren and Orcs cleared the area of the human inhabitants that were guarding the Oracle.</p>

        <p>Upon reaching the Oracle, Jaina Proudmoore, a human, was already present. Thrall, Cairne, and Jaina all spoke to the Oracle, who stated they must ally if they wished to defeat the Burning Legion. They agreed. The final fight against the Burning
          Legion, a horde of demons and evil, was victorious. Cairne pledged the Tauren to the Horde from that time on. </p>

          <h2>Founding of Durotar</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>Cairne assisted the orcs in the founding of Durotar, a nation they could live in peacefully, away from the tyranny of the humans. Following this, Cairne and his people left for Mulgore once again to establish a defense against the centaurs and
            harpies who continued to hunt the Tauren. Soon, another crisis would arise. Baine Bloodhoof, Cairne's son, was captured by the centaurs. Cairne fell into a deep depression, to the point that many of his people did not recognize this shell
            of a Tauren. Cairnes second, Tagar, attempted to bring Cairne out of this depressed state, but was unsuccessful. Tagar feared that the new Tauren civilization would not last long without Cairne's leadership.</p>

          <p>A short time later Rexxar and Rokhan arrived, seaking help from the Tauren once again. They hoped that Cairne and his warriors would help fight against a new human incursion, lead by Admiral Proudmoore and his Kul Tiras forces. Cairne told the
            orcs to leave, that he would not help, and that he wished Thrall to believe him dead. Tagar explained the to the orcish heroes that Baine had been captured. Rexxar and Rokhan, along with Bovan Windtotem took it upon themselves to rescue Baine,
            which immediately pulled Cairne from his lethargic state.</p>

          <p>Cairne, along with his warriors, fought alongside Thrall, defending the new orcish lands agains the humans. Cairne then returned to his people once again.</p>

          <h2>What Comes Next?</h2>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p>This story is only beginning. For those of us that have been playing World of Warcraft for some time, we were able to interact with Cairne in the game for many years. Though he died in battle, his memory lives on. </p>

          <p>But I won't tell you that story.</p>

          <p>Why? Because with the start of World of Warcraft Classic this summer, you can follow the story of Cairne, or at least the begging of it. </p>

          <p>If you genuinely want more of the story, head over to the <a id="tribute-link" href="https://wow.gamepedia.com/Cairne_Bloodhoof" target="blank">Cairne Bloodhoof Wowpedia</a> page to read up on what happens from the start of World of Warcraft up to his death before the Cataclysm.</p>
